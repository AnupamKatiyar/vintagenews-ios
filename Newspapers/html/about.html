                <p>This app allows you to browse through the entire collection of the Library of Congress' Chronicling America project. This app is entirely unaffiliated with the Library of Congress.</p>

                <p>In addition to the data provided by the Library of Congress, this app wouldn't be possible without the generous iOS developer community and their open source components.</p>
